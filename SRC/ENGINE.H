 For 8 tiles, pskybits = 3
 For 16 tiles, pskybits = 4, etc.

Most teams have a 1024 wide parallaxing sky that wraps all the way around.
Don't worry - this is the default now.  When initengine is called, the

You may have used a 512 wide parallaxing sky (like in my game) that repeated
every 180 degrees.  To make this work with the new version, set these
variables like this right after initengine is called:
 pskyoff[0] = 0;
 pskyoff[1] = 0;
 pskybits = 1;

Note that both pskyoff variables are 0 here.  This will make the parallaxing
sky repeat. With the new tiling, you can save memory by making small chuck
sizes, such as 64 or 128, and repeating certain sections.

/*
	(sx, sy) is the center of the sprite to draw defined as
		 screen coordinates shifted up by 16.
	(zoom) is the zoom in 16:16 format. Normal zoom is 65536.
	(ang) is the angle (0 is straight up)
	(picnum) is the tile number
	(shade) is 0 normally but can be any standard shade
	(pal) is the palookup number from 0-255.
	flags & 0x01:	Translucence
	flags & 0x02:	Scale to viewing window
	flags & 0x04:	Y flip
	flags & 0x08:	Don't clip to startumost/startdmost.
	flags & 0x10:	Position by top left corner instead of origin
	flags & 0x20:	Translucence using reverse translucency values
	flags & 0x40:	Don't check for mask color (faster)
	flags & 0x80:	Write sprite successively to all pages

	Auto-scale mode (kRotateScale) will automatically scale from 320*200
	resolution coordinates to the clipping window passed (cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2).
	In auto-scale mode, don't pre-scale the (sx, sy) coordinates.  Simply pass
	(sx, sy) as if the resolution was 320*200 even though it may be different.
	This means that you shouldn't use xdim or ydim to get (sx, sy).

	(cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2) - The clipping window.  These coordinates are never
	scaled, not even in auto-scale mode.  Usually you should pass them as
	(windowx1,windowy1,windowx2,windowy2) for things scaled to the viewing
	window or (0L,0L,xdim-1L,ydim-1L) for things scaled to full screen.
	Probably the only time you wouldn't follow this rule is if you program a
	non-scaled tiled background function.

	Note:  As a special case, if both (flags & 2) && (flags & 8) then
	rotatesprite will scale to the full screen (0,0,xdim-1,ydim-1) rather than
	setview's viewing window.  (windowx1,windowy1,etc.)  This case is useful
	for status bars, etc.
